//My notes: (please don't grade these they're literally my lecture notes ahaha)
//note: in c, functions cannot be defined inside other functions 

//The term unsigned char refers to a data type in C that represents a character without any sign (positive or negative).
//The keyword unsigned specifies that the variable can only hold non-negative values.
//For unsigned char, this means it can store values from 0 to 255 instead of the typical signed char, 
//which can store values from -128 to 127.
//When working with raw byte data or when you need to ensure that values are always non-negative 
//(such as when dealing with ASCII values), using unsigned char helps prevent unintended negative values.
//This is particularly important when comparing byte values (like in the is_ascii function), as 
//ASCII characters range from 0 to 127. Using unsigned char ensures that comparisons are made correctly without negative interpretations.
